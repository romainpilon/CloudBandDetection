# CloudbandPy

cloudbandPy is a Python package for detecting and tracking atmospheric cloud bands.

The cloudbandPy package detect tropical-extratropical cloud bands. This software can use various regular grid datasets.

This is currently the development software used for research.

## 1. Installation
Clone cloudbandPy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romainpilon/cloudbandPy.git
```

Go to the directory
```bash
cd cloudbandPy
```

Then install the package with
```bash
pip install -e .
```

Additionnaly, a conda environment.yml file is provided to create a conda virtual environment containing all librairies required. Before installing the package with pip, you may run

```bash
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

Then you may activate it
```bash
conda activate cloudbandpy
```

## 2. Input Data Requirements
cloudbandPy works with netCDF files using netCDF4's capability to handle 3-dimension arrays of gridded latitude/longitude data. Currently, cloudbandPy  supports ERA5 data on its regular grid. Irregular grids must be regridded to a regular grid beforehand.

The input data must contain at least 3 dimensions: time, latitude and longitude, in this order.
cloudbandPy only supports detection and tracking data on 2D arrays.


## 3. Usage
Before you run anything, make sure that the configuration file is set up the way you want it, i.e. setting up the input data directory, all the paths of the files, and so on

To run the cloud band detection, run the following command:

```python
python ./cloudbandPy/runscripts/run.py ./cloudbandPy/config/config_cbworkflow_southPacific.yml
```

Default settings:
- Input data are 3-hourly ERA5 OLR data with filenames written as such `top_net_thermal_radiation_yyyy.nc` where `yyyy` is the year.
- The detection period is 24 hours.
- Output files containing cloud bands are written in a specific directory that will be created in the current directory.
- Figures will be saved in a specific directory that will be created in the current directory.

Example run scripts are located in the `runscripts` directories.

To see specific use of the code, a set of notebooks are located in the `notebooks` directory.
